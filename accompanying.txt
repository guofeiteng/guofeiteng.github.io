Data Cleaning and Visualization

I created visualization by Plotly, which has emerged as a strong contender recently. After  account created, I uploaded my data set which already cleaned by Google refine. For example, when I build a bar chart for  Schedule & Cost Variance in US Department, I choose department name as x-axis, the Schedule Variance (%) and Cost Variance (%) as y-axis. After bar chart created,  I add title for plot, axis and customize the colors used. At last , share my plot in public and copy code from Embed plot in your site page to my webpage.

Errors in data set.
1.	Multiple Representations
Lots error in Multiple Representations, such as Department of Agriculture, Agriculture department and DOA .

2.	Data validation
For example, 2012-30-09 and 31/03/2012.

3.	Summation Records
Under every group data of department, there is a total data. It¡¯s not convenient for re-process. 

4.	Mixed use of numerical scales
Some of data have numerical scales, like 1.338($m).

5.	Mixed use of numerical scales 2
Some of number using different counting way, like 3083 and 3,083

6.	Data dislocation
        Lots of data in the incorrect position, such as put project name into start date. 

7.	For Unique Project ID, some data are right-aligned and some others are left-aligned.

Data enrichment
The total data in data set is not convenient for re-process, so I put all total data for different department into an independent dataset. At the same time, there are project names in different department, I counted the number of project in different department for my plot.


The overview for target users and interaction showed in my website.
